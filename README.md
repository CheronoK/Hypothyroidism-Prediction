# Hypothyroidism-Prediction-IP

This is a project that entails buliding a model from a dataset collected by  Nairobi Hospital after conducting a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients.

The project comprises of building models that determine whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.

## Description
The following are the steps taken to implement the solution :

Define the question, the metric for success, the context, experimental design taken.

Read and explore the given dataset.

Define the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given question.

Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.

Perform univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis recording our observations.

Building Decision Tree models using 2 out of the 3 advanced models.

Optimizing the models.

Identifying which of the 2 models is the most trusted

Using the trusted model to select the most important features that are impactful in prediction.

Building Support Vector Machine Models using the linear, polynomial and the radial basic function.

Picking the kernel that performs the best and also tune the parameters t improve the performance of the models.

Visualizing the model using any of the 2 features.

Use the best performing kernel together with the tuned hyperparameters and predict using aditional features.

Compare the model with the feauters version.

Challenge our solution and give recommendations as to how we could improve the model performance.
